# ReelStream

## Concept 
A web application that prompts a user to search for a movie and returns:
- General information about the movie (title, director, plot)
- An embedded video player to view the movie's trailer
- Where to stream the movie online (e.g. Netflix, Amazon, etc.)
- Recommendations for related movies

## Process
- UI was primarily built through Materialize.css
- JS uses multiple nested functions and four unique API calls to fetch search result data
- APIs used: YouTube, UTelly, OMDB, TMDB
